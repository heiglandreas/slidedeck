# Tech conference

Note: A tech conf. Everyone knows so much. A lot of advanced topics, so everyone here is advanced programmer. Let's get some things straight.

# First time?

Note: If it's your first time conference, don't be afraid! Take a look around! These are all first timers. There's a first time for all of us! And every one is as nervous as you are.

# Impostors

Note: Who of you thinks everyone else knows more than you? Have a look around. It's a common thing in tech. Noticed something about some of the speakers? They have it as well!

# Sessions

Note: visit the sessions! Usually the slides are published after the talk. You don't need to write them down. But write down what you think is important for you. Tweet slides that are important for you. Make (sketch)notes.

# Inspiration

Note: Let the sessions be an inspiration. Don't expect to see a solution for your specific usecase or problem. Don't expect to know everything after the session. You'll need to investigate but you'll have an idea of what tech x is capable of - or isn't

# Hallway-Track

Note: There's always an additional track! SOme say the quality of the conference can be measured on the hallway track… I know of people that come to a conf because of the hallwaytrack… Engage with others

# Pacman rule

Note: Keep a space open for others to join your "circle"



<!-- .slide: data-credit="Rob Allen" data-credit-url="https://flic.kr/p/TQcJUT" data-background="../base/img/012.jpg" -->
# Join

<!-- .slide: data-credit="Rob Allen" data-credit-url="https://flic.kr/p/Upzdey" data-background="../base/img/013.jpg" -->
# Connect

Note: Connect with others. Ask whether someone minds you to join them. A lot of people are introvert and uncomfortable with new encounters. Attendees as well as speakers. Try! You've got all the time you need. And remember: the conference isn't over after the end. Social, Talking on the way to the hotel, before the conf starts…

# Engage
Note: Ask speakers! Just because I say something that's not nececarily the truth. I might be wrong. (usually I'm not ;) Had an argument with THE sebastian bergmann once. turned out I wasn't wrong.

# Code of Conduct

Note: There is always a codex of how to behave. Either formalized as a CoC that includes ways of reporting people misbehaving or informal. Short: Don't be an asshole! Respect others! But don't overreact. Small threshold…
