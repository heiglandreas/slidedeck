## Excursion Time Coordinates



### GMT

* Noon depends on sun.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Offset of up to 16 minutes due differences in the earths rotation<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Offset egalises itself throughout the year.



### UT/TAI

* Depends on atomic clocks.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Started 1955<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Independent from solar orbit<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Offset of 36 seconds as of 30th of June 2015 against UTC<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Temps atomic international



### UTC

* Based on TAI<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Started in 1961<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* adds leap seconds every now and then<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* offset between UTC and GMT max. 0.9 seconds<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Started to become base of Timezone offsets from 1972

## Caveat

* Timezone - Sum of geographical region that shares the same coordinated time.
* Zonetime - The timeoffset against UTC (or GMT) of a geographical region



## To make it more complex



## Timezones change

## Summertime

Note: To save energie as because the human activity-cycle is offset to the daylight cycle
Summertime was "invented". Offsets the time 1 hour plus against default time-coordinate.
In germany in 1944 there was even 2 summertimes. Start of summertime is coordinated
but not the same in europe and america... 30 April 1916 Detusches Reich




##Summary

* Timezones are political definitions<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Timezones change<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Timezones cover a stripe from northpole to southpole<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Zonetimes are defined by the offset from UTC<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Summertime may add an hour to the Zonetime<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Summertime does not change the timezone but the zonetime<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
