# Gregorian Calendar

* solar calendar
* 365.2425 days
* introduced October 1582
* Th. 4th Oct. 1582 -> Fr. 15th Oct. 1582
* adoption from 1582 through 1923

Note: Russian olympics shooting team came late to the 1908 olympics due to difference in calendar
Greece (without Mt Athos) was the last to adopt the gregorian calendar. Carnival differences
are not due to that! (6 sundays without feasting). Turkey started counting years in 2006.
Sweden introduced and then reversed (30th feb. 1712). Introduction was a mess!

Note: All of these calendars use different start-dates, different referencepoints for year calculation, different year and month
lengths, different month and day names, I would not count on the same week-lengths and the same day-start logic.

# Alternate approaches

* French Revolution calendar
* Fixed calendar
Note: French revolution calendar: 12 months with 3*10 day week, last one free. Also decimal time. Fixed calendar: 13 months
of each 28 days (364 days) followed by a 1 (2 in leap years) special celebration day. Seems to have also been used by a lot of prehistoric cultures.
