# Testing PHP?

Note: We all write tests for our PHP-based applications. But what about PHP itself? Is the language itself actually tested?



* PHP itself is written in C
* <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->Whole testsuite of functional tests
* <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->Functional tests
 are written in PHP
* <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->Special format files ".phpt"



> You don't need to know C to write phpt-tests.

> <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->Though it helps ;)
