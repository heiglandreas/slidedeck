![Mail from Chris](deck/resources/mail.png)
note: This whole thing started with an [email by Chris Seuffert to the PHP-FIG mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/g/php-fig/c/lA8Lz0E4dWk/m/nvafR08MBAAJ) on the 4th of March 2021.
I was in hospital at the time and didn't have anything else to do (apart from requesting
pain medication and trying to walk for mor ethan 50 meters without having to stabilize myself
with the drip stand). And as the idea that Chris proposed targeted timezones I couldn't help
but leap for it.
But before we dive right into how the whole thing evolved, perhaps I should take a step back and first
check what this clock thingy is and why it is a great idea.

## Best Practices

Note: To do so we will have to dive into OP, SOLID and TDD to name a few. To cut things short:
We are talking about "Best Practices" in programming.
TO make one thing clear from the beginning: You do not need a clock to get code out and to solve
a business problem. But as you might hopefully see, it helps you in doing so.
And to make it easier to follow: Let's tackle a kind of real life problem to have some example code and not continue talking about some abstract stuff.
---
## The Challenge

Note: Let's imagine we are challenged with the following task:
---
> Filter all items that are in the future.

note:Sounds trivial, doesn't it? And yet it is a great way to show some best practices that
can help with that including a clock.
So to start we are given an Iterable that contains items with a datetime information.
Something like this:
---
```php [1|2-9]
$filter = new FiterFutureItems();
/**
 * @var $iterable array<array-key, array{
 *   time: int,
 * }>
 */
$iterable = array_filter($iterable, function($item) use ($filter) {
	return $filter->valid($item);
});
```
---
> Implement the filter
---
## Solution
```php [1,6|2-5]
final class FilterFutureItems {
	/** @param array{time: int} */
	function valid($item): bool {
		return time() < $item['time'];
	}
}
```
Note: That was easy. Commit code, create PR, task finished!
Until someone comes around and doesn't want to merge the PR because there are no tests...
Oh dammit.
I mean: Writing a test for this simple function should be easy, shouldn't it?
Well. It isn't *that* easy as it is right in the middle of some other code. So I have to adapt the test for that other code.
Or I create a separate function that I can more easliy test.
Let's use that second step.
---
## That was easy
---
### What about...
## <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"--> Testing
---
```php [4]
final class FilterFutureItems {
	/** @param array{time: int} */
	function valid($item): bool {
		return time() < $item['time'];
	}
}
```
---
## CHallenge

### <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"--> `time()` changes state constantly (sic!)
---
## Pure functions

* the function return values are identical for identical arguments
* the function has no side-effects

Note: Is our current filtering-function a pure function? No, it isn't. While it does not interfere with
state, it violates the first directive. It's return value is not identical for identical input values. So how can we
change that? Right! Injection!
---
## Old code
```php [3-4]
final class FilterFutureItems {
	/** @param array{time: int} */
	function valid($item): bool {
		return time() < $item['time'];
	}
}
```
---
> pass in comparison value
---
## Solution
```php [3-4]
final class FilterFutureItems {
	/** @param array{time: int} */
	function valid($item, int $currenttime): bool {
		return $currenttime < $item['time'];
	}
}
```
Note: Hm: Now we changed the function signature...
---
## Challenge
```php [3-4]
final class FilterFutureItems {
	/** @param array{time: int} */
	function valid($item, int $currenttime): bool {
		return $currenttime < $item['time'];
	}
}
```
---
## function signature changed
---
### Solution

## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> constructor injection
---
```php [2,5,6]
final class FilterFutureItems {
	public function __construct(private int $currenttime) {}

	/** @param array{time: int} */
	function valid($item): bool {
		return $this->currenttime < $item['time'];
	}
}
```
---
## write a test for that!
Note: Now I can create a test for the `filterFutureItems` class without an issue.
---
```php [1,2,13|3-7|9|10-12]
public function testFutureItemsAreFiltered(): void
{
    $items = [
    	['time' => time()-1],
    	['time' => time()],
    	['time' => time()+1],
    ];

    $filter = new FilterFutureItems(time());
    $this->assertFalse($filter->valid($items[0]));
    $this->assertFalse($filter->valid($items[1]));
    $this->assertTrue($filter->valid($items[2]));
}
```
Note: ANd the test works! Out of the box!
<br>Most of the time. But sometimes it doesn't.
<br>Why?
<br>Because sometimes we are faster than we expect it. And time() returns na new integer than before...
<br>we can fix that by assigning the current time to a variable and then use that instead!
---
### Challenge

## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Calling `time()` multiple times
---
```php [3|4-8|10-13]
public function testFutureItemsAreFiltered(): void
{
	$now = time();
    $items = [
    	['time' => $now-1],
    	['time' => $now],
    	['time' => $now+1],
    ];

    $filter = new FilterFutureItems($now);
    $this->assertFalse($filter->valid($items[0]));
    $this->assertFalse($filter->valid($items[1]));
    $this->assertTrue($filter->valid($items[2]));
}
```

Note: Works like a charm now.
<br>Just passing an int with the mental note "this is a timestamp" is going to be error prone.
Let's pass a ValueObject instead. Luckily we have one right at hand: DateTimeImmutable
---
### Challenge

## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Type-Safety
---
### Solution

## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Dedicated Type instead of int
---
```php [3|5-7|10]
public function testFutureItemsAreFiltered(): void
{
	$now = new DateTimeImmutable();
    $items = [
    	['time' => $now->getTimestamp()-1],
    	['time' => $now->getTimestamp()],
    	['time' => $now->getTimestamp()+1],
    ];

    $filter = new FilterFutureItems($now);
    $this->assertFalse($filter->valid($items[0]));
    $this->assertFalse($filter->valid($items[1]));
    $this->assertTrue($filter->valid($items[2]));
}
```
Note: That second part was easy. But what about the first part?
<br>We need to rewrite our filter class. Luckily we already have a class!
---
### Challenge

## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Rewrite Filter-Class
---
```php [2-4,7]
final class FilterFutureItems {
	public function __construct(
		private DateTimeImmutable $currenttime,
	) {}
	/** @param array{time: int} */
	function valid($item): bool {
		return $this->currenttime->getTimestamp() < $item['time'];
	}
}
```
---
## ðŸŽ‰
Note: Awesome! We now have a pure function! Problem solved! Let's go home!
---
### Challenge

## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Testing the calling function
Note: Or does someone spot an issue with that?
<br>May I draw your attention back to the original function?
---
```php [1]
$filter = new FiterFutureItems(new DateTimeImmutable());
/**
 * @var $iterable array<array-key, array{
 *   time: int,
 * }>
 */
$iterable = array_filter($iterable, function($item) use ($filter) {
	return $filter->valid($item);
});
```
Note: But... wait...
<p>Now we have the issue with testing the `doSomething`method. As we now have outsourced the instantiation of the
DateTime-object to there.
---
### Option

## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> use `time()`
Note: And yes: We could have done the same using an integer with `time()`
---
### Option

## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> move instantiation up one level
Note: So we can now fix that and move the invocation of the DateTime-instance into the next calling method and so on and so forth.
<p>But at one point we will have to do the instantiation.
<p>How do we handle that with other ressources?
---
### Solution
## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Factories

Note: Exactly: We use Factories.
<p>What is a factory? It is something that produces something that we need on demand. So we can inject the factory into a class or method and then request the resource when we need it. And when we don't need it no resource has been wasted.
<p>So let's create a factory for a datetime-object:
---
## Factory

```php [1,2,7|3-6]
final class CurrentDateTimeFactory
{
    public function getCurrentDateTimeObject(): DateTimeImmutable()
    {
        return new DateTimeImmutable();
    }
}
```

Note: And then let'S use that within the filter.
---
## Improve filter further

```php [3, 7-9]
final class FilterFutureItems {
	public function __construct(
		private  CurrentDateTimeFactory $currenttimefactory,
	) {}
	/** @param array{time: int} */
	function valid($item): bool {
		return $this->currenttimefactory->
			getCurrentDateTimeObject()->
			getTimestamp() < $item['time'];
	}
}
```

Note: This can now be called like this:
---
```php [1]
$filter = new FiterFutureItems(new CurrentDateTimeFactory());
/**
 * @var $iterable array<array-key, array{
 *   time: int,
 * }>
 */
$iterable = array_filter($iterable, function($item) use ($filter) {
	return $filter->valid($item);
});
```
---
## Only small changes necessary.
Note: Changes only necessary in instantiating the FilterFutureItems class.
<br>Achievement unlocked!
---
### Challenge

## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Testing?
---
```php [3|5-10]
public function testFutureItemsAreFiltered(): void
{
	$now = new DateTimeImmutableFactory();
    $items = [
    	['time' => $now->getCurrentDateTimeObject()
    	           ->getTimestamp()-1],
    	['time' => $now->getCurrentDateTimeObject()
    	           getTimestamp()],
    	['time' => $now->getCurrentDateTimeObject()
    	           getTimestamp()+1],
    ];

    $filter = new FilterFutureItems($now);
    $this->assertFalse($filter->valid($items[0]));
    $this->assertFalse($filter->valid($items[1]));
    $this->assertTrue($filter->valid($items[2]));
}
```
---
## We need a dedicated testing factory....
---
## But ...
```php [1]
final class CurrentDateTimeFactory
{
    public function getCurrentDateTimeObject(): DateTimeImmutable()
    {
        return new DateTimeImmutable();
    }
}
```
Note: <br>Testing is a bit more difficult, but still easier than before as we can now
mock or extend the CurrentDateTimeFactory and return a defined DateTimeObject for easier testing!
Oh! Wait a second...
---
> Final classes are either immutable or require an interface

> <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Removing the final is <b>not</b> an option!
---
## Interface
```php
interface DateTimeFactoryInterface
{
    public function getCurrentDateTimeObject(): DateTimeImmutable;
}
```
Note: Let's not depend on one class but on an interface that can then be implemented by different classes!
---
## First implementation:
```php [1]
final class CurrentDateTimeFactory implements DateTimeFactoryInterface
{
    public function getCurrentDateTimeObject(): DateTimeImmutable()
    {
        return new DateTimeImmutable();
    }
}
```
---
Inject that into the `FilterFutureItems` instance
---
```php [3]
final class FilterFutureItems {
	public function __construct(
		private DateTimeFactoryInterface $currenttimefactory,
	) {}
	/** @param array{time: int} */
	function valid($item): bool {
		return $this->currenttimefactory->
		getCurrentDateTimeObject()->
		getTimestamp() < $item['time'];
	}
}
```
---
```php
$filter = new FiterFutureItems(new CurrentDateTimeFactory());
/**
 * @var $iterable array<array-key, array{
 *   time: int,
 * }>
 */
$iterable = array_filter($iterable, function($item) use ($filter) {
	return $filter->valid($item);
});
```
Note: For production usage
---
Create our own test-factory ...
---
```php
public function testFutureItemsAreFiltered(): void
{
	$now = new DateTimeImmutable();
    $items = [
    	['time' => $now->getTimestamp()-1],
    	['time' => $now->getTimestamp()],
    	['time' => $now->getTimestamp()+1],
    ];
```
---
... using an anonymous class
---
```php
	$factory = new class extends DateTimeFactoryInterface {
        public function __construct(private DateTimeImmutable $now) {}
        public function getCurrentDateTimeObject(): DateTimeImmutable {
            return $this->now;
    }($now));

    $filter = new FilterFutureItems($factory);
```
---
```php
    $this->assertFalse($filter->valid($items[0]));
    $this->assertFalse($filter->valid($items[1]));
    $this->assertTrue($filter->valid($items[2]));
}

```
note: No need for a mock library any more! No magic happening here, everything is in
the tests!
<br>For those that want to go teh extra mile, you can now create your own factory classes
depending on the test-requirements. Like returning different DateTimeObjects on every call to 'now'. Or whatever else
<br>So now we can configure our DI container to always use the `TestDateTimeFactory` for test-environments and the `CurrentDateTimeFactory` for all other environments.
---
# Fin

Note: Thats about it.
---
# ðŸŽ‰
Note:And what does that all have to do with a clock?
<p>Well... What we just implemented is ... a clock
<p>What does a clock do? You call it (in case of the speaking clock literally) and it tells you the current time.
<p>That'S what we just implemented.
<p>We only need to rename some of the classes and interfaces:
---
## Rename
```diff
-interface DateTimeFactoryInterface
+interface ClockInterface

-final class CurrentDateTimeFactory
+final class SystemClocck

-new class extends DateTimeFactoryInterface
+final class FixedClock
```
Note: and also rename the method that we want to use
---
```diff

-public function getCurrentDateTimeObject()
+public function now()
```
---
## Why FIG

Note: So that's pretty cool. And it doesn't seem to be rocket science.
<p>After all the implementation of the clocks itself took us less than 20 lines of code.
<p>So what does the Framework Interoperability group have to do with that?
<p>Well. The thing is, that you can of course create your own implementation of this but wouldn't it be great if you could actually use your favourite DateTimeLibrary with that as well?
---
## Be interoperable
Note: Like Cronos? Or Carbon? Yes: both of them provide you with a `setTestNow()` method but that actually does not provide isolation and you have to stop the mocking process. And over all you are relying on the environment to make sure that your test can be ran instead of letting your function control it's requirements.
<p>Which is what is often refered to as **Dependency inversion**. Your code does not rely upon the global state but solely on the stuff that is injected into the class/method/function.
<p>So instad of depending on our own abstraction - our own custom build interface â€“ it makes more sense to rely upon a commonly aggreed upon interface that can be fulfilled by different libraries that are already available out there.
<p>And that is where the FIG comes into the whole thing.
<p>The Framework Interoperability group is an organistation that aims to provide interfaces for common problems so that they can be solved independent from a specific framework and allow interoperability between frameworks.
<p>To do so the FIG produces so called PHP Standard Recommendations: In short: PSR. So far there are 22 of them. Some of them are accepted, some are abandoned, some are deprecated and some are in a draft-mode .
---
## History
---
## PSR-0: Autoloading (2010)
Note: The first PSR â€“ PSR 0 â€“ was added to the FIGs  github repository in 2010 and changed the way how we built PHP applications by introducing a common way to autoload PHP-Classes. Before that it depended on the used framework (whether third party or self-build) whether and if so how classes were autoloaded. Now we hada common way of doing that so we could much easier create and include third party libraries. Without this common understanding composer would not have been possible and woulnd't probably have seen the light in 2011.
---
## PSR-4: Autoloading (2013)
Note: Yes, the first PSR was already superseeded by PSR-4 which allowed the usage of Namespaces in 2013 and so in 2014 PSR-0 was marked as deprecated. It is still available in composer.
---
## PSR-3: Logging
note: And there are many more such solutions to common problems like Caching or Logging (to name a few). And there are also some PSRs that are in Draft mode for years like PSR-5 which targets PHPDoc blocks.
---
## PSR-6: Caching
---
## PSR-8: Huggable
note: For PSR-20 I hope that we are not **that** long in a Draft state.
<p>But in the end it all stands and falls with the editor and the sponsor of the PSR. Those are the ones responsible for addressing all issues and finally calling for an acceptance vote to get the PSR accepted.
<p>So: To get back to the beginning:
---
## How did I get involved

Note: As I already told you: I was in hospital and had nothing else to do.
<p>And the first draft was ... interesting. Chris proposed an interface that had a number of functions. The general idea to have a Clock-Interface was a no-brainer. If I recall correctly no one actually questioned that. The only thing that was questioned - and to be fair: mostly by me - was whether all those methods were necessary.
<p>The first draft contained these methods:
---
## Initial Proposal
```php [1-8]
interface ClockInterface
{
    public function timestamp(): int;
    public function immutable(): DateTimeImmutable;
    public function datetime(): DateTime;
    public function microtime(): float;
    public function timezone(): DateTimezone;
}
```

note: When I read this my first thought was a quote from Derick Rethans
---
> DateTimeImmutable is what DateTime should have been in the first place <br>(Derick Rethans)

Note: The DateTime class has been the cause of so many datetime related issues in PHP that it is hard to keep track to be honest. People tend to forget that the DateTime class is mutable so any change that they are doing on an instance will happen **to that instance**. And as objects are passed by-reference any change to an object done in a function will stay with that object also outside the function. Which has caused nasty bugs.
<p>To avoid that Derik introduced the DateTimeImmutable class in PHP5.5. And wherever we are using Datetimes in PHP we should by now use DateTimeImmutable to avoid mistakes. It makes things much more explicit.
<p>And if you need â€“ for whatever reason â€“ a DateTime-instance, there is always the `DateTime::createFromImmutable()` method that you can use.
<p>So we actually don't really need the `public function datetime(): DateTime;` declaration.
---
```php [1-4,6-8]
interface ClockInterface
{
    public function timestamp(): int;
    public function immutable(): DateTimeImmutable;
    //public function datetime(): DateTime;
    public function microtime(): float;
    public function timezone(): DateTimezone;
}
```

Note: Also the `public function timezone(): DateTimezone;` is not necessary as the timezone is already part of the DateTimeImmutable (and the DateTime) class. So we can skip that one as well.
---
```php [1-4,6,8]
interface ClockInterface
{
    public function timestamp(): int;
    public function immutable(): DateTimeImmutable;
    //public function datetime(): DateTime;
    public function microtime(): float;
    //public function timezone(): DateTimezone;
}
```
Note: So we are now left with `timestamp()`, `immutable()` and `microtime()`.
---
```php [1,2,4,6,8]
interface ClockInterface
{
    //public function timestamp(): int;
    public function immutable(): DateTimeImmutable;
    //public function datetime(): DateTime;
    public function microtime(): float;
    //public function timezone(): DateTimezone;
}
```

Note: But a DateTimeImmutable-object also has the `getTimestamp()` function which makes sure that you will get the correct unix-epoch timestamp. And that is regardless of the set timezone.
---
```php [1,2,4,8]
interface ClockInterface
{
    //public function timestamp(): int;
    public function immutable(): DateTimeImmutable;
    //public function datetime(): DateTime;
    //public function microtime(): float;
    //public function timezone(): DateTimezone;
}
```

Note: And for the microtime a similar thing applies. You can get the microtime via a call to `(float) DateTimeImmutable::format('U.u');`.
<p>So in essence almost all methods from the interface can be handled in the calling code as needed by just using **one** method from the proposal: `public function immutable(): DateTimeImmutable;`.
<p>So the decission was very soon taken to only have that one method and leave it to the user to actually convert that DateTimeImmutable instance to whatever the user needs.
<p>And renaming that one method from `immutable` to `now` was then only a matter of ... time...
<p>So we were left with a very simple interface like this:
---
```php [1-4]
interface ClockInterface
{
    public function now(): DateTimeImmutable;
}
```
---
## ðŸ˜´ Sleep

Note: Some other questions that popped up regarded the standardization of `sleep()` or `wait()`.
<p>Those were considered to be out of scope for this PSR as they try to solve a different problem than trying to retrieve the current time. That was easy to convey and the people that seen this as an issue to be solved via a FIG-interface are more than welcome to start another PSR.
<p>The interface should only do one thing and that really well. Which is described by the S and the I in SOLID.
<p>So far for the easy things. With those out of our minds we could have started the acceptance vote. But there was still one thing to be clarified:
---
## ðŸ˜± Timezones!!

Note: So far the only restriction that the PSR imposes is that the returned instance has to be a DateTimeImmutable object. It should represent the current time in a production environment. But that is it.
<p>No further restrictions.
<p>And of course it took only (felt) seconds until the question was raised: Why don't we require the returned DateTimeImmutable instance to be in UTC?
<p>And to be honest: The reason why this PSR is not yet accepted is because it is extremely hard to convince people that it is not *necessary* to enforce that.
<p>Yes: I am advocating to store date-time informations of current things like log-informations or creation or modification times and stuff like that in UTC. It indeed makes the most of sense. But storing information and handling information are two different things. And here we are talking about handling the information.
<p>And why should the interface limit use-cases where the timezone is relevant by enforcing once specific timezone? Espechially when a timezone can be enforced via something like
---
```php
$clock->now()->setTimezone(new DateTimezone('whatever you want'));
```
note: And if you want to get the timestamp from the DateTimeImmutable you will **always** get the timestamp in UTC (as that is the definition of the Epoch timestamp).
---
## Excursion: What is "now"

<div id="dg-container">
    <div class="dg-wrapper">

    </div>
</div>

Note: "Now" requests a "slice of time". And the slice is one thing. it is unique. How that specific slice is refered to in
a certain location - whether on Montreal or Amsterdam or on Mars is irrelevant. That might become of interest
when we have to leave the COntext of PHP - persistence, display in the frontend, Message Queuss come to mind
we have to think about that! BUt not while we are within PHP. As we have a ValueObject that handles
all relevant interactions without us having to know where the specific time is observed.
---
```php [1-5|6-7|9-11]
// When I created the slides
$a = new DateTimeImmutable(
    '2024-05-13T20:57:00',
    new DateTimeZone('Europe/Zurich')
);
// Now
$b = new DateTimeImmutable();

// Did I prepare the slides in Time?
var_dump($a < $b);
// true
```
Note: I can compare datetimes with one another, I can get the difference between two datetimes etc:
<p>Even comparison against timestamps works easily via `getTimestamp()`.
---
> Having to know the timezone of a datetime-object is a code-smell for me

Note: So there is no need to *enforce UTC on the interface level*.
<P>That does **explicitly not** mean that you can not enforce UTC on the implementation level! No one is keeping you from using a `UtcClock` or something like that. `lcobucci/clock` and `ergebnis/clock` for example both provide a `SystemClock` that uses a defined timezone like this:
---
```php
// Set clock to Paris time
$clock = new SystemClock(new DateTimezone('Europe/Paris'));
// Set clock to UTC
$clock = new SystemClock(new DateTimezone('UTC'));
```

Note: So the PSR currently does not limit you to one specific timezone but allows you to choose the one that suits your application best.
<p>And always differentiate between the interface and the actual implementation. The implementation can of course be more strict than the interface. But the strictness of the interface can not be removed by the implementation. That's part of Liskovs substitutionprinciple (The L in SOLID)
<p>And the fact that we can now change the behaviour of userland code by injecting a different kind of Clock we are fulfilling the Open-Closed principle (The O of SOLID)

## Conventions

* SystemClock: Production factory. Sometimes timezone specific
* FrozenClock: Testing with dedicated datetime object(s) injected
---
```php
class Foo {
    public function __construct(private ClockInterface $clock) {}

    public function doSomething(): void
    {
        /* @var DateTimeImmutable */
        $now = $this->clock->now();
        // Do whatever needs to be done
    }
}
```
---
```php
interface ClockInterface
{
    public function now(): DateTimeImmutable;
}
```
