Note: Hey: I'm andreas and I'm a PHP adict. And I have a soft spot for dreaded
things like dates, times, timezones and calendars. On a professional basis:<br>At the time this all started I was working @ bitExpert. But as this story unfolds, I was lying in the hospital
with nothing to do other than checking my emails.
