# Scaling Diversity

Note: Hello everyone. Let's talk about diveristy and especially how to scale diversity.




<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/6018152146_cdde025925_o.jpg" -->

Note:
I'm presuming that we all here agree that diversity in itself is a vital factor for the success of a team.
Whether that team is a project-team, a department or a whole company is in that view not really relevant. 
<br><br>The main thing is that a team can handle the given tasks in a competitive and efficient way. 
And having a diverse set of ideas, approaches, attitudes etc makes a team more competitive and more efficient.



![Hi, I'm Andreas](resources/andreas.jpg)

Note: With that out of the way one of the first questions is: Why am I here telling you this? Am I qualified to talk 
about diversity? After all im an old white male so I should be the least qualified to talk about that subject.



* Team Lead at [bitExpert](https://bitExpert.de) (We're hiring 😉)
* Co-Organizer of [PHPUGFFM](http://phpugffm.de)
* OSS-Contributor
* Maintainer of different OSS-libraries

Note: On the other hand, I'm also a team-lead at bitExpert, a german software-development company and as such I'm 
responsible for handling the staffing of my team. And if there is one thing that I have learned in my past 20-plus 
years of professional software-development carreer, it is, that there are much more important things than being
able to do a btree-sort algorithm on a whiteboard. When I'm hiring (which I am currently kind of doing – 
nudge nudge, wink wink) I'm usually looking for people with a diverse background.
<br><br>People that bring new talents, new views, new ideas to the table.
<br><br>And I am also usually not trying to find someone that will fit into an existing team. because as soon as 
someone new starts to work in a team that team is actually forming completely from scratch again. One of the 
things that I was thankfully able to learn at weCamp. Therefore the team will recreate. And usually – 
as long as everyone is respectful to everyone else – the new team will at least not be less efficient.
<br><br>But I'm not a professional on that matter. I can only tell you my experiences and about the stuff I have seen. 
This is just thought to be said here to create a common ground from which I want to explore how we can scale 
these diversity aspects for a team. From a local level up to a global level and what things we can do to actually 
get the best talents that are out there. Now as well as in the future.



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/43468161710_427c7a95d6_o.jpg" -->

Note: Because here is my actually professional background kicking in. Sadly I can't really say "Why didn't I 
learn something decent". Because I did. I am actually a Master of Forestry sciences. (don't ask! There are reasons 
why I ended up in software developments that I will happily answer after the talk as they are not really relevant
here) But what *is* relevant is that the most important thing in forestry is that you do not harvest whatever you
plant. Neither will your children or their children. The things you start out will influence – and will be
influenced by – the upcoming generations. It's a generation-contract. <br><br>I'm doing the best I can now so that in 
the future me (or my great - great - grandchildren) will have the best of all options. That is one of the 
core-principles of sustainability.  Realizing that there might not be an immediate benefit. That I might not
be the one gaining from that benefit. <br><br>Why that becomes important we will see in a minute or two.




# The Best™

Note: For now let's have a look at the current situation when it comes to hiring in a lot of teams:
<br><br>Of course we want only "The Best™".
<br><br>And yet we generally already apply two exceptions. <br><br>The first one is that those best actually accept to work 
for a salary that matches our range. And even though most of the time that range is not even given in the 
Job-advert, we generally expect the contestants to express their expected salary in their cover letter. And 
often enough people that would perfectly fit would get sorted out due to not matching that salary range.
And the second implicit exception is generally, that the person in question has to live within a certain 
distance around the common location of the team so that they can commute daily to meet with the team in an office.
<br><br>Hm.
<br><br>Two Exceptions to your rule to hire "The Best™" that make it almost impossible to actually hire them. 
So while you want the best you most likely won't get them. And especially the location part will remove
a number of candidates that might have the diverse background that you are looking for but that are just not 
capable or willing to comply with that precondition of yours.



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/70mileRadius.png" -->

Note: So – cost aside – your potential to hire "The Best™" covers about 15.400 square kilometers of the earths 
surface (estimated commute distance of 70km). Which is about 0.01% of the earths land-surface. 




<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/metropolregionAmstertdam.png" -->

Note: Yes. Agreed
<br><br>that's not equivalent to the number and distribution of people! So let's have for example a look at the 
Amsterdam metropolitan area. There are about 2.5 Million people living there that one could reach with a 
job-advert as described above in the area. That is about 0.03% of the worlds population.
<br><br>Still not really that much.
<br><br>OK. There might be people willing to relocate to amsterdam for a great job opportunity. I know some. 
But even with those few willing to relocate you are not able to gain the full potential.




<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/kids-making-noise-and-disturbing-mom-working-at-home-4474035.jpg" -->

Note: Luckily for a lot of us there was this pandemic coming along. OK. The pandemic itself was pretty devastating 
and has show the worst in a lot of areas. And I'm not wanting to discuss the topic of the pandemic here 
in any way. But it has caused some of us to rethink how we work. Suddenly teams were able to work in a 
decentralized way....
<br><br>Let me rephrase that: Suddenly teams were forced to work in a decentralized way. And very often the internal 
structures were not well aligned with that. And working from home during a pandemic is something completely 
different than working remotely.
<br><br>But regardless of all these stresfull things that happened, it suddenly allowed us to overcome this 
geographic restriction. We suddenly had to change from an on-site workflow to an off-site workflow. 
Digitize and document information that previously could be stored on-site. Whether that was in a physical 
folder in a filing cabinet or in the head of colleague X that we could just walk up to. But that suddenly
enabled us to hire from ... all over the world!
<br><br>Well... in most of the cases: It didn't!
<br><br>With one restriction gone there were now two new restrictions coming up. The first being: The person needs to 
be within the country. Because: Tax and Insurance rules. What do we as the hiring part need to figure out 
regarding employees that live in a different country. There is a hell of a lot of things to take care of to 
not make that a financial desaster or even land you in jail. So that is a pretty serious issue. On the other
hand it's not something that we can overcome as a team as that is a "Layer 10" problem. You might be able 
to solve that by not actually hiring the person as an employee but by hiring the person as a "full time"
freelancer. Which again might have some legal impacts. But I'm sure there might be ways around that.
But the other restriction is one that you might actually again add implicitly. With videochat being so
immanent now it is so easy to have the team distributed but yet work together. <br><br>So what is that restriction?



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/timezonesAroundCest.png" -->

Note: Well. It's timezones. <br><br>No I'm not going to wander off, but having team meetings via video-chat only works
when you are all more or less working – or at least available – at the same time. <br><br>So again: This implicit
restriction which has something to do with how you organize your team and your teams work, keeps you from 
getting the full potential. Yes. You now have a much wider number of possible applicants. But again 
to stay at the example of the Metropolitan area of Amsterdam: We are in essence talking about 3 to 4 timezones.
That spans an area of around 15° west to 30° east. From somewhere like la palma to somewhere like st.petersburg. 
From northpole to southpole. So that includes already most of europe and almost the entirety of africa. 
That's pretty much already. But you are still missing out on america and australia. Not to talk about asia.
And to be honest: While we still have a pretty diverse setup within those 2 continents already, we are
still missing out on a lot of cultures.
<br><br>So what does that mean? We need to change. If we want to be able to get the full potential of possible hires, 
of new ideas, of different cultural backgrounds, of different ways of thinking, we need to adapt our own 
processes. Our own way to work.
<br><br>Diversity is not something that we can put on top of our existing processes. It is not 
something that comes at no cost. Diversity is something that we have to actively embrace 
and work for. It means adapting our own processes. As a company, as a team and as an individual.
And in this case: If we want to be able to tap into the whole global market, it means that we have to adapt 
our workflows from a syncronous workflow towards an asynchronous workflow.




<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/shoppingList.jpg" -->

Note: Document even more. Plan well in advance. Write everything into tickets/issues/tasks/cards (whatever 
you want to name them). make everything as transparent as possible. And then also think about 
how you can get an adjustable table into the last area on this globe. In case you want to hire 
someone from there.



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/theWholeWorld.png" -->

Note: Once we are there, we have reached peak diversity!
well...
Have we?
Sure we have! We can hire every talent no matter where they live!
Can we?



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/1920px-Above_Gotham.jpg" -->

Note: While we have solved the geographical and the timezone restriction, there are still 2 implicit 
restrictions open. The first being the salary range.
Well, that's easy now that we can hire worldwide as we can hire from all those countries with cheap labour!
Sorry to say so: But what if the actual talend that we want and need comes from, lives in and doesn't 
want to relocate, New York? They clearly are out of our salary range.
I have no good idea on that topic. And we don't need to go as far as New York. Try to hire someone from 
switzerland and you will have the same issue. Cost of living there is much higher than in
Amsterdam (and it might still be high in amsterdam, but believe me: Zurich is higher). 
The question you will have to ask yourself is: Is the person, and the persons contribution to your team,
worth it? If it is: then you will have to bite the bullet and pay the person whatever needs to be paid.




<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/30343973267_43519bbf22_k.jpg" -->

Note: But how do you calculate what needs to be paid? Well. This is a rather personal approach here, 
and you will most certainly find different ones and most certainly also contradicting ones. Check them 
and use the one you are comfortable with or the one that you can sell to your stakeholders or the one 
that fits best to your needs.
But in my opinion a teammember should be able to afford a certain standard of living. Which one that 
is, is up to you to define. But you will need to think about that. What standard of living should my 
teammembers be able to afford. Should they be able to buy a new yacht every other week or should they 
just be able to go out with their significant other once a month to the next pizza place or should they 
barely be able to make ends meat. It's up to you. But once you figured out a standard of living, 
you can figure out how much that person in New York or Switzerland needs to be paid to be able to afford that. 
And that will be more than their colleagues in Amsterdam get. At least in terms of (converted) euros.  
But not in terms of standard of living.
That will need a lot of convincing to your current teammates why that person gets more money. And it will 
take some time until they realize that while they get more money, they will not get more luxury.




<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/30343593627_d74625a748_k.jpg" -->

Note: And when we apply that to countries like switzerland, we can also apply that to all other countries or areas. 
Last week I had a discussion with my significant other regarding salaries in eastern germany 
compared to western germany. And while I'm absolutely sick of that being the case – why can't we, 30 years 
after the unification of germany, have the same salaries throughout the whole of germany – one of the 
reasons is that also the cost of living is a bit less in the eastern part of germany. 
That doesn't add up completely, but when we want to apply that principle to different countries we might 
also have to apply that *within* a country.
And that would also mean that we need to figure out a way to calculate the cost of living and how much 
someone needs for a certain standard of living in – whatever: Nepal. Or India. Or Uganda. Or Togo.
The only thing I am pretty sure of: It will be less than what the teammates in Amsterdam get.
Is that exploitation?
I wouldn't say so. But I'm not 100% sure to be honest. My reasoning is that we would still allow 
the people from whatever country to afford a certain way of living. And would we pay everyone the same 
amount of money as their Amsterdam colleagues there would be some teammembers that would be able to live 
in luxury while others would barely make ends meat. And by paying luxury salaries in low-cost countries 
that would in addition most possibly cause the local industry to collapse. And suddenly we are thinking 
about things much wider in scope than our own team. We are thinking about how our payment might influence 
the way a foreign nation might evolve. Pay developers for foreign countries dazzling salaries and suddenly 
everyone might want to work for foreign companies and the local industry collapses with whatever impact 
for the country. Of course people in Kathmandu or Sophia – and I was so lucky to actually meet a few 
developers in those places – have the same expectation to their work-environment as others have – 
like working on a macBook, have decent internet (not that complicated there though), have an iPhone – 
so we will have to compensate for that. But on the other hand the average salary in those countries is so low, 
that we would allow our teammates to live in luxury would we pay them the same amount of money.
But as I said: Those are my personal views on the topic of payment in a global team.



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/43468542570_78d1f1bf34_k.jpg" -->

Note: And suddenly we are deep into politics and sustainability. We are not only thinking about our generation but 
also about how our decissions might influence other generations in foreign countries.
But: We have solved all our issues regarding world wide hiring and being able to have the most diverse 
team that we can!
Hm...
Have we really?
We have solved issues regarding timezones, asynchronous work, payment in different countries and areas. 
What should stop us now?
What about: Cultural differences?



![Objective Distribution](resources/objectiveDistribution.jpg)

Note: We don't need to go as far as India or Japan to find cultural differences. And cultural 
differences that might actually hinder our team. 
And while this for sure is an exageration and plays with stereotypes it bears also a tiny bit of truth. 
And while I can not back this with scientific studies, I have some "anecdotal evidence" as that is called 
nowadays. I do have some friends from eastern europe that match exactly into that image. I also have some 
friends from eastern ewurope that do *not* match into that image. But either way. There are differences 
between different cultures that cause trouble within teams. And the farther the cultures are from one 
another, the more complicated it becomes to realize that there are differences. Imagine working together 
in a team where one person always says that everything is fine because they culturally fear to tell others 
that they failed. Failure in itself for western european people is not a nice thing. We started to learn 
that failure is OK. But when someone was raised within a culture where failure is a sign of weakness that 
is intolerable and one rather dies than to accept that they failed, then you might realize you have an 
issue in your team. And not a small one.
How can such a thing be solved? Telling them, that failure is OK? Well. That might be an idea. 
But wouldn't that also mean telling them that their concept of failure is not accepted within the 
team? That their complete cultural background is not accepted within the team? That's pretty devastating 
and – at least to me – sounds like completely contrary towards the idea of a diverse team. After all you 
hired the person also because of their different background. And now that background is considered wrong?
That worked pretty well for hundreds of years. That phase was called colonialization. In which the 
western countries divided the world between them. And in which every country wanted to be like the 
western countries. Some more some less. And while I don't want to dig into that topic deeper, 
we still have to fight the aftermath of all that ruckus. And I'm not talking about wars 
(or at least not yet) but about things that we consider normal and standard while they 
aren't – in other parts of the world.
While we are all using english when we want to communicate with one another, why english? Why not french 
or spanish or portuguese? Or even dutch? Or russian or Chinese? Because most of the countries throughout 
the world at one point or another in their history in the last 500 years came into contact with 
the British Empire. Yes. There are countries like china or russia where that isn't the case. 
But as most of the countries can use english, we decided to use english as the main language. 
And Esperanto just didn't fly. And believe me: Once you're in a country where there is no english around: 
You can feel completely lost!





<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/foreingPoliticians.jpg" -->

Note: What about Dress-code? Look at the way politicians throughout the world clothe. European. 
Calendars: European. Education: European. People want to attend the elite universities of the world. 
That are all in european hand (Sorry, but I'm counting the united states here as european as well, 
as the US is based on western european values). So while we want to get a diverse setup we have 
the issue that we have to integrate completely different ways of thinking into one team. That is hard.
That doesn't mean it doesn't work: It just means it is a sh*tload of work and requires a really subtle 
guidance to keep the balance.
And we do not have to have people from China, India, Tanzania, Chile and Germany in one team to have 
such an explosive mixture. No need to have someone from Tel Aviv and someone from Damascus in one team. 
No need to have someone from the US and from Afghanistan in one team. It might be completely sufficient 
to have 4 people from Mannheim in that team. One with Algerian, one with Italian and one with turkish 
ancestors and possibly an israeli person as well. 4 different backgrounds that can cause a pretty 
explosive mixture. But it can also cause an extremly efficient team due to that.




<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/PRI_176989960.jpg" -->

Note: But those examples remind me of some other thing that will cause problems: What about having people
in your team that come from areas that some country or other have "beef" with? 
You suddenly might run into issues that you can't even solve on your own.
Like having awesome teammembers from Nepal or Serbia that can't visit your teams in-person retreat due to 
them not getting a visa - either because of fear of them not going back or due to just
too long processing times.
Or that awesome person from Iran that suddenly is blocked from your code repository
due to someone enforcing rules you do not have an influence on. 
Or that great person from China that suddenly can't access your companies VPN anymore. 
Or that brilliant lady from Afghanistan that suddenly doesn't reply any more.
Suddenly *your* diversity strategy doesn't work anymore because of some weird geopolitical situation.
And such a situation might come up suddenly. I hope you got that lady out of Afghanistan safely. 
And hopefully well in advance. But sometimes these situations can happen without any announcement. 
And then you should have a "Plan B" somewhere.
So then. Now we have indeed planned everything. We know how to handle actual diverse teams. How to tackle 
different cultural backgrounds and geopolitical difficulties ands disasters. Now we are well prepared 
for our diverse hiring process!
I'd say: Yes you are!



![Survivorship Bias](resources/survivorship-bias.png)

Note: 
But!
<br><br>We might be looking at this from the wrong angle.
<br><br>You see: There is this thing called survivorship bias.
During second world war US navy engineers tried to figure out a way to easily increase the 
armour on planes. For that they checked planes and figured out where they were hit. 
At a first glance it looks easy to add some armour to reduce those hits. But on a second 
though the problem here is, that our sample is wrong as the planes that would have 
needed the additional armour weren't able to come back and be part of the sample. So those 
parts that have no hits are actually the most vulnerable parts that need to be secured.
What does that mean for our case of diversity?




<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/7717344594_4a43cec858_o.jpg" -->

Note: We are currently only able to look at those that actually made it to become a software engineer. 
We are not taking into account all those that weren't able to make it. And that does 
not mean those that were able to become layers or builders or politicians. I'm talking 
about those that just weren't able to focus on an education at all.
Those that weren't able to afford an education.
We are talking about 25% of the worlds population that has no secure access to enough food. 
2 Billion people that have other things on their mind than deciding whether to become a software 
engineer or a Lawyer. 2 Billion people that are literally struggling to make ends rice. 2 Billion 
people were we don't need to care whether they speak english or french or spanish as they don't want 
to talk to us as they have stuff to do to get some food onto the table. And this is not going to 
improve with our ongoing climate change.




<!-- .slide: data-background-image="resources/Bildschirmfoto-20211010173400-1920x1080.png" -->

Note: So by fighting climate change we can also increase the chances of those people to at least live 
a better life. And perhaps even reach the point where they can think about wanting to become an engineer.
And even if we take them aside, there are still those hundreds of thousands of people that barely 
made it into school and that now can't afford a computer to start becoming a software developer. 
Luckily there are schemes out there that help in those cases. I first stumbled upon that when 
a friend of mine told me about such schemes in Johannesburg where he observed a group of kids 
that were able to use a schools computers after hours. And I was like "What the actual f...". 
There are people out there wanting to learn this stuff but can't because they can't afford it. 
And just the other day I read of "Apps and Girls", a foundation in Tanzania that tours throughout 
the country to give espechially young women access to computers and teach them how to program. 
And I assume there are dozens if not hundreds of such or similar organizations around. All those 
need help! All the help they can get.

Note: To foster and grow the next generation of diverse teammates that we can hire.
Or perhaps they can hire us? Why should we always be the ones that hire? Why shouldn't 
we work for a company in Iran? Or Chile? Or Mozambique? Or...

Note: Sorry for delving into this topic of world politics while all we want is to hire a diverse set of people.
But if you truly want diversity that includes politics not only on a local level but also on a global level. 
Some things we might not be able to change like world hunger. But some things we actually might be able to 
change. Like reducing electronic waste or waste in general, Like investing into reforestation schemes, 
like avoiding things that require deforestation in the first place, like supporting programs that 
help people to learn how to help themselves, like avoiding huge power wastes (like bitcoin),
like... you get the picture
<br><br>support Phil or any other cause to apply the boy scout rule: Leave the place in a better state
