# History

Note: To gt a better understanding we'll have to use the way-back-machine to dive into the history of LDAP
Waaaaaaay back.



* **1865** - Formation of the *International Telegraph Union ([ITU](http://www.itu.int/en/pages/default.aspx))*
* **1947** - ITU becomes a specialized agency of the *United Nations (UN)*
* **1956** - Formation of the *Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique (CCITT)*
* **1993** - the *CCITT* is renamed to *International Telecommunication Unit Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)*

Note:
* ITU assists in the development and coordination of worldwide technical standards (recommendations).
* ITU is the only international organisation that defines recommendations. Most other organizations (DIN) are national organizations.
* Most standards by the ITU are created by ITU-T sector (Standardisation)



## Some ITU-T Departments

* **E** - Overall network operation, telephone service, service operation and human factors
* **H** - Audiovisual and multimedia systems
* **X** - Data networks and open system communications

Note:
Recommendations are subdivided in different series.
Any of these known?




## Well-Known recommendations of ITU:

* E.164 (International phonenumber-scheme, ENUM)
* H.264 (Videokompression)
* X.509 (Public-Key Infrastructure)
* X.500 (Electronic Dircetory-Services) should be (X.500-X.599 - Directory)




## X.500

* Nov. 1988 - [version 1 of the X.500 recommendation](http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/recommendations/rec.aspx?rec=11732)
* Overview of the concepts with the following numbers as  completion.
* Complete implementation extremly complex (OSI, Session-overhead).
* Current Version 7 of 2014




**RFC 1487** (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) was created in 1993.

Obsoleted by **RFC 1777** (LDAPv2) in 1995 and **RFC 3494** in 2003 (LDAPv3)

Note:
Due to the complexity of X.500 RFC 1487 was created in 1993 to complement DAP by
a protocol that provides simple read/write interaction with a directory.
Therefore LDAP is 3 years older than HTTP (RFC 1945 in 1996)!
