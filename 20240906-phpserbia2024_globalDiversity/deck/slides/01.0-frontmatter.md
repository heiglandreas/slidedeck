![Hi, I'm Andreas](deck/resources/andreas.jpg)

Note: With that out of the way one of the first questions is: Why am I here telling you this? Am I qualified to talk
about diversity? After all im an old white male so I should be the least qualified to talk about that subject.

# The Best™

Note: It'S all about hiring. <ul>
<li>company we want to find The Best applicant</li><li>as a
developer we want to find The Best match.</li>

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="deck/resources/kids-making-noise-and-disturbing-mom-working-at-home-4474035.jpg" -->

Note: <ul><li>Pandemic taught us to work remotely - teams could be decentralized</li>
<li>Work from home != Working remote</li>
<li>Some people are not made for that!!!!!</li>
<li>Suddenly geographic restrictions can fall!</li>
<li>Workflows became digital, Online Meetings etc</li>
<li>One restriction gone, 2 new up<ul><li>Employment rules (Tax, Insurance etc)</li>
<li>And the second restriction is</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="deck/resources/aroundOffset.png" -->

Note: Sory about that! Timezones! <ul><li>EUrope and Africa only</li>
<li>Pretty diverse already</li>
<li>But we are missing out Asia, Australia and all of America!</li>
<li><b>We</b> need to change!</li>
<li><b>Workflows</b> need to change!</li>
</ul> We need to adapt our processes. As company, as team as individual

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="deck/resources/shoppingList.jpg" -->

Note: <ul><li>Document even more.</li><li>Plan well in advance.</li>
<li>Write everything into tickets/issues/tasks/cards (whatever
you want to name them).</li><li>be as transparent as possible.</li>
<li>Use written chat! Use Emojis! Be empatic</li><li>As a company: think about
how you can get an adjustable table into the last area on this globe. In case you want to hire
someone from there.</li></ul>

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="deck/resources/theWholeWorld.png" -->

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="deck/resources/LosAngeles.jpg" -->

Note: <ul><li>Solved geographical and timezone issue</li>
<li>One restriction still unsolved: Salary range</li>
<li>Easy! Now we can hire cheap labour!!!! SOlved!!!</li>
<li>What if The Best lives in SanFrancisco and doesnt want to relocate?</li>
<li>Cost of living there is high, so they might be out of the salary range</li>
<li>Question you have to ask is: Is the person worth the cost?</li>
</ul>

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="deck/resources/Equity.jpg" -->

Note: <ul><li>How do you make that decission?</li>
<li>Do you want the person? Then oyu bite the bullet!</li>
<li>Cost of licing is different in different places</li>
<li>BigMac Index</li>
<li>A teammember/I should be able to afford a certain standard of living.</li>
<li>THink about that! What is YOUR standard of living you want?</li>
<li>And then figure out what the price of that is where you live</li>
<li>Or where the hire lives</li>
<li>Teammembers will get the same in terms of living standard.</li>
<li>But that might not be the same in terms of Euros, US-Dollar or Denari</li>
<li>Needs a lot of convincing. But might be the fairer option</li>
</ul>

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="deck/resources/30343593627_d74625a748_k.jpg" -->

Note: <ul><li>When we apply that to areas like LA we can apply that everywhere</li>
<li>Within countries</li><li>Between countries</li><li>What is the cost of licing in Nepal, UGanda, India, Togo</li>
<li>Is that exploitation?</li>
<li>I say: NO</li>
<li>It'S about providing a standard of life.</li>
<li>Not an abstract number on a bank account</li>
<li>While some can barely make ends meat, others live in pure luxury</li>
<li>People will not work within their country with all the related issues</li>
</ul>

Note: <ul><li>No need to go to India or Japan.</li><li>differences that might actually hinder our team.</li>
<li>The further the differences, the more trouble in the team</li>
<li>Failure is not an issue in western culture, but in eastern</li>
<li>Rather dead than failure - You have a PROBLEM</li>
<li>How to solve</li>
<li>Is our western approach the better one?</li>
<li>Negating their cultural context?</li>
<li>Colonialization</li>
