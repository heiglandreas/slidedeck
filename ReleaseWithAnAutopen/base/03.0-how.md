# How?



## Preparation

```bash
$ git archive --format zip --prefix=[prefix]-[tag] [tag] > [project]-[tag].zip
$ git archive --format tar.gz --prefix=[prefix]-[tag] [tag] > [project]-[tag].tgz
```



# Hash

```bash
$ shasum -a 256 [project]-[tag].zip
39e9b35d8bd3a49c44cd0c4587840b95f3118d5e01d229732247488036bb0d02 [project]-[tag].zip

$ md5 [project]-[tag].zip  
MD5 ([project]-[tag].zip) = fea46f2c025e99ea40b66f81fcaca895
```
Note: MD5 and SHA1 are insecure. SHA256 works. BUT



# Verify Hash

* Download code
* Generate the hash
* Verify that the hash matches



# Hash

> A hash verifies integrity, not source!

Note: The code has not been altere after the has was created. But everyone can create the hash




# Signature

```bash
$ gpg -a --output [project]-[tag].sig --detach-sig [project]-[tag].sig
```



# Verify the signature

```bash
$ gpg --verify [project]-[tag].sig [project]-[tag].sig
gpg: Signature made Di  4 Jul 16:12:14 2017 CEST
gpg:                using RSA key 34732BF394FE14BC022510608CDA8F73A8B843F0
gpg: Good signature from "Andreas Heigl <andreas@heigl.org>" [ultimate]
```



# Signature

> A signature verifies integrity *and* source

Note: The ode has not been altered after it was signed with the private key of the signer. 
The source of the key is therefore validated!



# PPP

Public Private Partnership

* public key: verify and encrypt
* private key: sign and decrypt



#  S/MIME vs. GPG/PGP

* Both are public/private-key based
* GPG: Decentralized - web of trust
* S/MIME: Centralized - hierarchy



# S/MIME

* HTTPS-Certificates
* Root-CA
* Special CodeSigning Certificates



# GPG/PGP

* Distributed
* Peer-to-peer
* No special Certificate needed
