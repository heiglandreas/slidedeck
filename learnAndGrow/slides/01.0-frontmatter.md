## A personal story about learning



<!-- .slide: data-background="resources/curiosity.jpg" -->

note: Curiosity is the key. And I still believe therte are no cats on mars. Curiosity can bring you anywhere.
Remember alarmclock that I wanted to know how it works. Still dont knopw how computers work.
Interest in getting to the bottom of things. CUriosity not only technical

Note: Don't underestiomate your own knowledge. You are not an imposter. Took me a while (about 15 years)
And I still struggle with it. Feedback helps.

Note: So surrounding yourself with people you trust and you can and want to learn from is important

<!-- .slide: data-background="resources/stage.jpg" -->

Note: You can stand on a big stage. Believe me that's intimidating. But you learn more when you teach



<!-- .slide: data-background="resources/time.jpg" -->

Note: But there'S a constraint to that. Time. Conferences, Usergroups reading dabbling in stuff takes time.
Time you can get via the Learn&Grow program. It lets you grow *and* the company. because

> **What happens if we don't and they stay?**

Note: It's not only in your interest, it's also in the companys interest as we are working in a fast changing industry
We have to stay on top. Workwise. But also non-work wise
